Program Overview
This program is a utility designed to automatically install and configure WinRAR on a Windows system. If WinRAR is not already installed, the application downloads and installs the latest available version of WinRAR silently, without user intervention. After installation, the program configures WinRAR with a custom registration key, allowing users to start using the application immediately.

Launching WinRAR: After configuration, the application automatically opens WinRAR so that users can begin using it immediately.
Benefits:
Fast and Easy Installation: Users don’t need to do anything manually—the program handles installation and configuration.
